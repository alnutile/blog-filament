I wanted a way to centralize the site copy so when clients need to edit a something it is easy for me or them ðŸ˜± to go edit it in one place.

https://github.com/xiCO2k/laravel-vue-i18n this library seems to solve the problem. 

I had to do 1 or two things though to make it all work.

```javascript
    .use(i18nVue, {
        lang: 'en',
        resolve: async lang => {
            const langs = import.meta.glob('../../lang/*.json');
            if(lang === 'php_en') {
                return await langs[`../../lang/${lang}.json`]();
            }
        }
    })
```

if I did not do the `if(lang` it would have en errors since there where other files in that folder.

And since I put my file in the `lang/end/trip.php` file I had to reference it like this

```javascript
trans("trip.waiting_list")
```

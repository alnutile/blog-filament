Need to quickly setup ssl and default to that for our sites.

This [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-on-nginx-for-ubuntu-14-04) made it simple stupid for getting the certs setup.

Then I wrapped up the redirect as seen below

~~~
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name somesite-dev.stagingarea.info;
    root /home/someuser/somesite-dev.stagingarea.info/public;

    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;
 
    # Prevent a look
    if ($ssl_protocol = "") {
       rewrite ^   https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;
    }

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    charset utf-8;
}

Thanks to this post as well [http://serverfault.com/a/298803](http://serverfault.com/a/298803)

Still a mystery but 

~~~
service nginx restart 
~~~

was not working had to do 

~~~
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
~~~

to get the server to reload.

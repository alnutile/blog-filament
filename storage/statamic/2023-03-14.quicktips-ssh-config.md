When I have to SSH into a server, which I try not to do. Basically everybody has a config file. In there. I'll move him into it. So SSH Config. In this file, you can add if it's not there these type of this line, these lines, and you could have many of them. So for example, this is a host. I'm going to call quick tips.

        text: "So now when I want to SSH into that server, I don't have to remember the IP or the name. I can just say SSH quick tips. And you'll see I'm in the SSH folder. That really doesn't matter. I could be in any folder. And if I do SSH tab, it will complete it. So if I just knew the server began with a Q I guess, tab over and it would finish the word for me, and then I could just press enter. "

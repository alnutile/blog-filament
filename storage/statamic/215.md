<p>Been using Drupal Services on a project and there are some docs on how to use a Class with this. But to instantiate it I was using a function per class method. Instead I now I have one function that can instantiate the Class and method based on the &#39;callback&#39; and the path 0 arg. Later I would like to just use the $_REQUEST type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can see the service below starting on line 4</p>

<p>Note the callback then calls to this function on line 127 which then just instantiates the class for me and calls the method.</p>

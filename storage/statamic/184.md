Just a quick note to self about ALB and Lambda. When using Lambda behind and ALB for routing your response has to be formatted properly else you will get a 502.

[https://pypi.org/project/alb-response/](https://pypi.org/project/alb-response) solved this problem. 

```
from alb_response import alb_response

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    response_dict = process_the_event(event)

    return alb_response(
        http_status=200,
        json=response_dict,
        is_base64_encoded=False,
    )
```

The results are easy enough to do by hand but I had a bit of time really finding out the format to respond with other than JavaScript and that casing there was a bit confusing.

During the install [https://github.com/laravel/spark](https://github.com/laravel/spark) I kept getting this error

Finally I went into my ~/.composer folder. Removed `composer.lock` then I edited the `composer.json` to look like this

~~~
{
    "require": {
        "laravel/envoy": "~1.0",
        "laravel/installer": "~1.1",
        "laravel/spark-installer": "~1.0"
    }
}
~~~

I use Envoy for a lot of my projects so I left that there and made sure to update my installer.

Then I ran, in that folder composer update.

Finally I made sure to add the path to my ~/.bash_profile as 

~~~
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/alfrednutile/.composer/vendor/bin/
~~~

Then ran `source ~/.bash_profile` 

With all that in place I could go to my new Laravel install to run `spark install`

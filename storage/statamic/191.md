<p>As I build out these sites I had to run heroku commands on heroku since the admin site needs to setup Domains and Subdomain on each new site. I was glad they had the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb" target="_blank">https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb</a>&nbsp;gem&nbsp;that made it possible to make an interface for administrators to add domains and subdomains to their heroku site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my controller I included the heroku-api as the node on the github page.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/f487851c7dd0cb01a4fb.js"></script>
<p>After that, on an update or a create I check if the domain exists.</p>

<p>There was another post on github in the issue queue to help me figure out how to <strong>rescue out of an error</strong>. Ideally though I would direct the user back to the edit page with an error message or autocomplete as they type. But right now I save their settings to the Partner model and show the error.</p>

<p>This allows me to use the &quot;heroku domain:add --app APPNAME domain_name&quot; command from within the app.</p>

<p>Setting up the ENV variables are explained on setting up heroku pages like this one&nbsp;<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars" target="_blank">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars</a>&nbsp;so you can do this at the command line and note store it in a file on git.&nbsp;</p>

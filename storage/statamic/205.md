<p>I had to update other items on the page including an CSV export as the user made filter changes on the site.</p>

<p>I had to pass the results of ng-repeat into a model and then the filters as seen here</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/9673298.js?file=index.html"></script></p>

<p>And in my controller I added a watcher to process the new results as needed.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/9673298.js?file=reportController.js"></script></p>

<p>This simple solution I had some trouble grasping.</p>

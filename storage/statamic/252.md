It is built off of the php-github-api client seen [here](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api) by KnpLabs . They made a really nice client that uses Guzzle and an AbstractionAPI to make it easy to code out different classes around the API endpoints.

Anyways I have had such a good experience with github one I figured it would be nice to have one for the Saucelabs work I do.

[https://github.com/alnutile/saucelabs_client](https://github.com/alnutile/saucelabs_client) more features will be added shortly as it is being used in a couple of decent size projects.

There are plenty of Tests to show how to use it.

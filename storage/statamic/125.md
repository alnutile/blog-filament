Recently I needed to create an OAuth around Machine to Machine authentication [here](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport#client-credentials-grant-tokens)

The docs are good but I must have missed something obvious or maybe I just well missed something obvious.

Basically I just kept getting `Unauthenticated.` and this makes sense since I received the token using

```
grant_type:client_credentials
client_id:1
client_secret:foobar
```

So after following the docs I had to then to the following


```
Route::middleware('auth:api')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request;
});
```

with

```
Route::middleware('auth.client')->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return "FOO";
});
```

**'auth.client'** being key!

And updated `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'auth' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
        'auth.basic' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth::class,
        'bindings' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
        'can' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize::class,
        'guest' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
        'throttle' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
        'auth.client' => \Laravel\Passport\Http\Middleware\CheckClientCredentials::class,
    ];
```

Adding `auth.client` then I was back in business.

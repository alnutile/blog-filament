Had a interesting issue with Laravel and the [cast feature](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/eloquent-mutators)

Basically a Chinese set of characters would be converted to their unicode counterpart [http://php.net/manual/en/json.constants.php](http://php.net/manual/en/json.constants.php)

So saving  "你好，世界" would become "\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c" in the database.

Making it hard to search for "你好，世界"

But I just wanted this data as it was, so later I could query the data and interact with it in it's default character state.

Digging into the Model class `vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.php:3044` I found that this method would `json_encode` but with no options.

So on my model I had to override that

```
    protected function asJson($value)
    {
        /**
         * Alter Cast
         * Default is altering unicode
         */
        return json_encode($value, JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE);
    }

```

And now "你好，世界" would save that way to the database and not "\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c"

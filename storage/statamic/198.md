<p>Using Behat and Mink I had to make a test that would verify the height of content on the screen compared to the rest of the window size. For example it had to be 30% of the screen or more.</p>

<p>You can see the code below.</p>

<p>It allows the user to pass in the expected height % and the element they would like to target. I will optmize it to allow more options than just ID.</p>

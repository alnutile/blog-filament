At work [Andrew Cavanagh](https://twitter.com/cavanaghacea) and I had to, using many examples on of libraries we use, to finalize how to branch and version our libraries.

There should be one branch for each major version (`1.0`, `2.0`, etc).  

These should be the only branches besides `master`. 

Releases within these versions should be tagged following semantic [versioning guidlines](http://semver.org/) (`v1.2.3` for example).  

In general, all work should be done via pr from the `master` branch and then merged into whatever the current branch is.  

The only exception is when you are making minor or patch version changes to a previous version.  

For example, if the most current version is `2.0`, then any changes to master via pr and then merged in to the `2.0` branch.  However, at that point any changes required by the `1.0` branch would be made via pr off of the `1.0` branch.  See fig.1 for an example.

When creating a new version, the package's `composer.json` should alias `dev-master` to the latest version:

```
"extra": {
  "branch-alias": {
	  "dev-master": "3.0-dev"
  }
},
```

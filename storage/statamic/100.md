<p>This took a few settings to get it working.</p>

<p>For one I put the correct paths in for karma and webdriver</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/9518483.js"></script>

<p>I then had to download mocks http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.14/angular-mocks.js even though I used angular-seed and setup my module to include this &#39;ngMockE2E&#39;</p>

<p>This page was a good starting point http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMockE2E/service/$httpBackend</p>

<p>Then there is the testing end 2 end frame work https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/ that allowed me to easily write non-unit tests</p>
